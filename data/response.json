    "advice": "You’re over budget by $29.27 today, driven almost entirely by unusually high Home ($246.21) and substantial Health & Fitness ($120.53) spend.\n\nKey observations\n- Total spend is $371.74 vs a $342.47 budget (8.5% over).\n- Home dominates the day: $246.21 (66.2% of all spending); this is the primary reason you missed budget.\n- Health & Fitness is also significant at $120.53 (32.4%); combined with Home, these two categories account for 98.6% of spend.\n- Miscellaneous is negligible at $5.00 (1.3%), so “small leaks” aren’t the issue—this is about a couple of large decisions.\n- If Home/Health spending continues at this pace without offsetting cuts, you’ll keep running deficits; you need either a one-time explanation (e.g., bill/repair) or a deliberate reallocation.\n\nSpecific adjustments by category\n- Home: Identify what portion was fixed/one-time (rent, utility bill, repair, supplies). If discretionary (decor, non-urgent items), pause additional Home purchases for the next 7 days and defer anything non-essential; aim to offset at least $25–$30 by delaying or canceling the next Home-related spend.\n- Home: If this was a necessary one-off (repair/annual payment), reclassify it mentally as “planned irregular” and plan a weekly sinking-fund amount going forward so it doesn’t blow up daily/weekly budgets.\n- Health & Fitness: Audit today’s $120.53—if it includes a membership, class pack, supplements, or gear, avoid any add-on purchases this week and cap additional Health & Fitness spending to essentials only; prioritize using what you’ve already paid for.\n- Health & Fitness: If part of this is recurring (membership), ensure it’s the best-value plan (downgrade tier, pause, or switch to lower-cost options) and set a monthly cap that fits your overall budget.\n- Misc: Keep it stable; no action needed beyond maintaining the habit of limiting unplanned small purchases.\n\nA simple plan for next week (3 steps)\n1) Categorize today’s Home and Health & Fitness charges into “recurring vs one-time vs discretionary” (10 minutes), and write a short rule for each (e.g., “no Home purchases unless safety/maintenance”).\n2) Set a 7-day freeze on discretionary Home spend and a strict Health & Fitness cap (essentials only) to recover at least $30 across the week and get back to budget.\n3) Do a 2-minute daily check-in: record spending before end of day and, if you’re over the day’s target, choose one specific item to defer the next day to compensate (not a vague “spend less”)."

    "advice": "1) One-sentence diagnosis  \nYou’re well under budget this month, but spending is concentrated in discretionary areas—especially Shopping and Personal Care—so tightening those categories now will prevent end-of-month creep while preserving your surplus.\n\n2) Key observations  \n- Total spend is 3,787.64 against a budget of 10,416.67, leaving a large cushion of 6,629.03; you have room, but the current mix suggests discretionary drift risk.  \n- Shopping is the largest category at 950.60 (25.1% of spend), a typical “leak” category where small purchases add up quickly.  \n- Personal Care is high at 703.70 (18.6%), which often includes subscriptions, salons, cosmetics, and convenience services that can be optimized without major lifestyle impact.  \n- Home spending is 546.47 (14.4%); this may be seasonal/maintenance-driven—worth checking for one-off vs. recurring costs.  \n- Kids/Pets (395.67; 10.4%) and Gas/Transport (372.40; 9.8%) are meaningful but more “needs-adjacent”; costs here can usually be reduced via planning rather than pure cutting.  \n\n3) Specific adjustments by category  \n- Shopping (950.60): Put a 7-day cooling-off rule on non-essentials, batch purchases into one planned order per week, and set a hard cap for the rest of the month (e.g., keep weekly shopping to a fixed amount and track it live).  \n- Personal Care (703.70): Identify any subscriptions/auto-refills and pause anything non-essential; cap salons/spa/cosmetics to one planned spend for the remainder of the month and switch routine items to a preset “replenishment list” only.  \n- Home (546.47): Separate “maintenance/repairs” from “improvements/decor”; defer improvements until you confirm end-of-month totals, and get quotes/price comparisons for any upcoming home spend over a set threshold.  \n- Kids/Pets (395.67): Review pet supply frequency and switch to bulk/subscribe-and-save only for true staples; for kids’ extras, set a weekly envelope amount and pre-plan upcoming activities to avoid impulse add-ons.  \n- Gas/Transport (372.40): Combine errands into 1–2 trips, check if any driving is avoidable via delivery/pickup on one consolidated day, and track cost per fill-up to spot any abnormal increases (pricing, driving patterns, vehicle efficiency).  \n\n4) A simple plan for next week (3 steps)  \n1. Categorize the last 2 weeks of transactions into “essential vs. discretionary” within Shopping and Personal Care, and identify the top 5 merchants driving those totals.  \n2. Set two weekly caps for next week: one for Shopping and one for Personal Care, then pre-commit to exactly when you’ll spend (one planned shopping window, one planned personal-care window).  \n3. Do a 10-minute midweek check-in: compare actuals to the two caps, and if you’re over pace, freeze discretionary purchases for 72 hours and re-evaluate at week’s end."
